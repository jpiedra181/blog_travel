		Alright, let me be honest with you â€” this isnâ€™t a full-time travel blog. I mean, yeah, I love to travel, and yeah, I love to write about it. But this site? Itâ€™s part of something bigger.
	</p>

	<p>
		Iâ€™m learning to become a front-end developer. This blog is one of the ways Iâ€™m leveling up â€” building something real, something personal, something that doesnâ€™t just sit in a tutorial folder collecting digital dust.
	</p>

	<p>
		The goal? To improve my skills and eventually build beautiful, functional websites â€” like this one, but even better.
	</p>

	<p>
		So yeah, itâ€™s a passion project. But itâ€™s also a playground. Iâ€™m experimenting with layouts, components, content systems, and all the little details that make a website feel alive.
	</p>

	<p>
		And hey â€” if you're reading this and thinking, "Iâ€™d love a website like this for my own project," or "Iâ€™ve got an idea but no clue where to start" â€” hit me up.

		Letâ€™s build something together â€” whether it's your blog, your business site, or something wild and creative we dream up over coffee.
