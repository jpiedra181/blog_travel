I didn’t exactly *plan* to visit Monaco. It was more of a “why not?” situation — I was nearby, the weather was good, and the train ticket was cheap.

Monaco feels like stepping into a movie where you don’t quite belong, but no one stops you from walking around anyway. Everything is shiny. Clean. Fancy. The buildings look like they’ve been ironed, and every third car is something you usually only see in racing games.

I walked past the Monte Carlo Casino just as a red Ferrari pulled up and a guy in sunglasses stepped out like he owned the world. Maybe he did. I wouldn’t know.

But here’s the thing — just a few blocks down from all the flash, there’s a small path that leads you to the sea. I bought a sandwich from a local bakery and sat on a rock by the water, watching yachts bob gently in the distance. It was quiet. Simple. Weirdly peaceful.

For a moment, Monaco stopped feeling intimidating. It just felt... sunny and blue and full of contrast.

Would I live there? Probably not. But for a few hours, it was a strange, beautiful little escape from reality.
